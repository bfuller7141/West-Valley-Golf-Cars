  We often hear the question, *"What do I need to do to maintain my golf car?"* If you haven't asked yourself this yet, you should—because just like your vehicle, a golf car requires regular maintenance to stay in top condition. A well-maintained golf car ensures a smoother, trouble-free ride and extends the lifespan of your investment.  


  However, maintenance varies depending on the type of cart you own—whether it’s gas-powered, lithium battery-powered, or a traditional battery system.  


  ### How Often Should You Service Your Golf Car?  


  A general rule of thumb is to have your golf car serviced **at least once a year**, regardless of whether it is used daily or has been in storage for an extended period. Regular service not only helps prevent breakdowns but also saves you from costly repairs in the long run.  


  At **West Valley Golf Cars**, we offer **annual service by trained professionals** who take a comprehensive approach to maintenance. From basic checks like battery water levels to inspecting accessories and identifying potential issues, we ensure your golf car is in peak condition.  


  For around **$100 a year**, routine maintenance helps keep your golf car running properly and protects you from unexpected repair costs.  


  ## What’s Included in an Annual Golf Car Service?  


  Our team services **thousands of golf cars each year** to ensure our customers enjoy a reliable, safe, and comfortable ride. Here are just a few of the key areas we inspect during a top-to-bottom service:  


  ### 1. Check Battery Water Levels  


  For electric golf cars with traditional lead-acid batteries, **water levels must be checked every three weeks**. Low water levels can lead to battery damage and reduced performance.  


  - Fill only with **distilled water**, never tap water.  
  
  - Water should sit about **½ inch above the lead plates**.  


  ### 2. Clean and Inspect Batteries  


  Battery maintenance is critical for performance and longevity. Over time, dirt and corrosion can build up, leading to power loss and shorter battery life.  

  - **Remove corrosion and dirt** from battery terminals.  
  
  - **Ensure battery connections are tight** to prevent power loss.  


  ### 3. Check Tire Pressure and Condition  


  Properly inflated tires improve the **comfort of your ride**, **battery efficiency**, and **tire lifespan**.  


  - Low tire pressure forces the motor to work harder, reducing battery life.  
  
  - We check and adjust tire pressure to the **manufacturer’s recommended PSI**.  


  ### 4. Inspect and Lubricate Brake Cables  


  Brakes are one of the most overlooked parts of a golf car, yet they are **crucial for safety**.  


  - Brake linkages and cables **should be greased and adjusted** to ensure they engage properly.  
  
  - We check for signs of **wear and tear** to keep you safe on the road.  


  ### 5. Lubricate the Steering Mechanism  


  A stiff or unresponsive steering wheel can make your golf car difficult to handle.  


  - Steering wheels and racks need **regular greasing** to ensure smooth operation.  
  
  - We check for any **loose or worn components**.  


  ### 6. Inspect Essential Accessories  


  If your golf car is **street-legal**, it’s important to ensure all required accessories are in working order:  


  - **Seat belts, headlights, turn signals, and brake lights** should be checked and tested.  
  
  - Weak batteries or loose connections can cause flickering or dim lighting.  
  
  - The **onboard computer** must function properly to regulate charging and overall performance.  


  ### 7. Battery Pack and Charger Inspection  


  For electric carts, the battery pack and charger play a crucial role in performance.  


  - We ensure the **charger is functioning correctly** and that all connections are secure.  
  
  - Battery issues can often be prevented by **checking for early warning signs** of wear.
