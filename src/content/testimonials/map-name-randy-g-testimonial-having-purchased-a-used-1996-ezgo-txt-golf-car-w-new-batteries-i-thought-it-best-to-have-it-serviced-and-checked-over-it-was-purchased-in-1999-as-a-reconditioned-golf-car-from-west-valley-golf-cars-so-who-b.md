testimonial: Having purchased a used 1996 EZGO TXT golf car w/new batteries, I
  thought it best to have it serviced and "checked over." It was purchased in
  1999 as a reconditioned golf car from West Valley Golf Cars, so who best to
  service it? They did an overall service, adjusted the brakes and steering, and
  installed a battery watering system for easy refill. They cleaned the battery
  compartment and the underside as well. I asked for two extra upper windshield
  clips, and those were provided. They picked up my cart in the morning and
  returned it in the evening. We were at dinner, and they used the garage door
  opener (attached to the cart) to put the cart in the garage. Talk about going
  that extra mile! I am delighted with their prompt service and plan to have
  them maintain this cart for the duration of my ownership. I highly recommend
  them as their prices are affordable, and who does SAME DAY SERVICE
  anymore????? Kudos to West Valley Golf Carts!
