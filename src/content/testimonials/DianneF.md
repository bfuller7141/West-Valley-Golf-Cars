testimonial: I took in our golf cart to get service and was looking for some
  recommendations on some repairs. The response and communication started from
  day one. From the time of scheduling pick up to the day the returned our golf
  cart. We got daily communication of what was going on and the status of our
  golf cart. Best service I have ever received! Top Notch!
